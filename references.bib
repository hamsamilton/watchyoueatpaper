              in cities1,2. This has led to a widely reported view that
              urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global
              rise in obesity3-6. Here we use 2,009 population-based studies,
              with measurements of height and weight in more than 112 million
              adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean
              BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from
              1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm,
              more than 55\% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to
              2017-and more than 80\% in some low- and middle-income
              regions-was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large
              contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of
              women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate
              or faster in rural areas than in cities in low- and middle-income
              regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing-and in
              some countries reversal-of the gap in BMI between urban and rural
              areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women.
              In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a
              persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an
              urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that
              enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid
              replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries
              with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails
              excessive consumption of low-quality calories.",

               with various sensors such as an accelerometer and a gyroscope.
               Similarly, smartphones are already being used for activity

               recognition. We evaluate these two devices for their strengths
               and weaknesses in recognizing various daily physical activities.
               We use three classifiers to recognize 13 different activities,
               such as smoking, eating, typing, writing, drinking coffee,
               giving a talk, walking, jogging, biking, walking upstairs,

              intake via automated tracking of wrist motion. Our method uses a
              watch-like device with a micro-electro-mechanical gyroscope to
              detect and record when an individual has taken a bite of food.
              Two tests of the accuracy of our device in counting bites found
              that our method has 94 \% sensitivity in a controlled meal
              setting and 86 \% sensitivity in an uncontrolled meal setting,
              with one false positive per every 5 bites in both settings.
              Preliminary data from daily living indicates that bites measured

               examines whether factors germane to the characteristics of

               Utilizing the technology acceptance model (TAM) as the base

               perceived enjoyment and perceived self-expressiveness, which are

               custom hardware that may not be practical as their usability and
               energy efficiency have not been validated. In this paper, we
               propose to use off-the-shelf Bluetooth headsets to unobtrusively
               monitor and detect users' eating episodes by analyzing the
               chewing sound. The challenges of using commodity acoustic
               hardware include the limited sampling rate that reduces feature
               fidelity and the impact of environment noise in real-world
               settings. Our experimental results show that the traditional
               kernel-based approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) could
               achieve 94-95\% classification accuracy in lab settings, though
               the detection performance quickly degraded to 65-76\% for
               in-the-field testing. We then propose a novel Deep Learning
               based classification technique that drastically improved
               detection accuracy to 77-94\% despite the existence of ambient
               noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to

               energy leading to obesity is a predictable outcome of market
               economies predicated on consumption-based growth. The global

  abstract = "Obesity is a public health crisis that has reached epidemic
              proportions. Although intensive behavioral interventions can
              produce clinically significant weight loss, their cost to
              implement, coupled with resource limitations, pose significant
              barriers to scalability. To overcome these challenges,
              researchers have made attempts to shift intervention content to
              the Internet and other mobile devices. This article
              systematically reviews the recent literature examining
              technology-supported interventions for weight loss and
              maintenance among overweight and obese adults. Thirteen studies
              were identified that satisfied our inclusion criteria (12 weight
              loss trials, 1 weight maintenance trial). Our findings suggest
              that technology interventions may be efficacious at producing
              weight loss. However, several studies are limited by methodologic
              shortcomings. There are insufficient data to evaluate their
              efficacy for weight maintenance. Further research is needed that
              employs state-of-the-art methodology, with careful attention
              being paid to adherence and fidelity to intervention protocols.",
